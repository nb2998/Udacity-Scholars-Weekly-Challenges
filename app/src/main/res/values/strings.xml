    <string name="info_relative_layout">RelativeLayout is a view group that displays child views in relative positions. The position of each view can be specified as relative to sibling elements (such as to the left-of or below another view) or in positions relative to the parent RelativeLayout area (such as aligned to the bottom, left or center).</string>
    <string name="info_card_view">A FrameLayout with a rounded corner background and shadow. CardView uses elevation property on Lollipop for shadows and falls back to a custom emulated shadow implementation on older platforms. Due to expensive nature of rounded corner clipping, on platforms before Lollipop, CardView does not clip its children that intersect with rounded corners. Instead, it adds padding to avoid such intersection (See setPreventCornerOverlap(boolean) to change this behavior).</string>
    <string name="info_scroll_view">A view group that allows the view hierarchy placed within it to be scrolled. Scroll view may have only one direct child placed within it. To add multiple views within the scroll view, make the direct child you add a view group, for example LinearLayout, and place additional views within that LinearLayout.</string>
    <string name="info_grid_view">A view that shows items in two-dimensional scrolling grid. The items in the grid come from the ListAdapter associated with this view.</string>
